### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I am GÃ¶nÃ¼l! Computer Scientist by day, and people person by day and night. During my [PhD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x7zLq8lsl7mp05H2NlNhHBs3zTRPzwWo/view?usp=sharing) in Computer Science, I focused on Trustworthy AI (privacy, uncertainty, and explainability), designing personal assistants capable of helping users manage their privacy online. Completing my PhD was a significant and proud milestone in my life. As for my post-PhD life, I currently work as a Data Scientist. I am also a passionate advocate for women in technology, with a history of organizing and mentoring in global communities such as Django Girls and Python conferences.
